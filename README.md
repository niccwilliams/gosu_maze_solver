# gosu maze solver
A ruby program using Gosu that generates a maze, allows for the user to define a custom path, and then solves the path upon user input. The path generated is not guaranteed to be the shortest. Left clicking on blocks will mark them as being part of a Maze. Right clicking anywhere on the program window will begin the search function. The program will search for a path from the left-most side of the screen to the right-most side. If these sides are not connected, no path will be found.

What did I learn?
  - Basic recursion, depth-first search.
  - Working with the Gosu library for Ruby.
